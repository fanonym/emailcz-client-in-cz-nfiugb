You want to create a React Native + Expo 54 app tailored for an email.cz client, specifically targeting Czech users and optimized for Android TV. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Email Inbox:** A primary screen displaying the user's inbox with a list of emails.\n*   **Email Detail View:** A screen to view the content of a selected email, including sender, recipient, subject, and body.\n*   **Settings/Preferences:** A screen to manage user preferences, potentially including language settings (Czech as default), notification settings, and account management.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f4f7` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#2196f3` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#03a9f4` (Light blue)\n    *   Accent: `#ff5722` (Orange)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#bbdefb` (Light blue, a lighter shade of the primary color)\n*   **Typography:** Use a clean, modern font like \"System\", which is the default on most platforms, ensuring readability on TV screens.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Adapt UI for Android TV:** Modify the app/(tabs) folder to ensure the UI is optimized for larger screens and remote control navigation, which is essential for Android TV.\n2.  **Localization:** Implement Czech language support throughout the app.\n3.  **Remove Demos:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the implementation, the app will be more tailored to your specific needs.\n\n**Coding Agent Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Modify UI for Android TV:** Review the app/(tabs) folder and modify the UI to ensure it is optimized for larger screens and remote control navigation. This might involve adjusting font sizes, button sizes, and layout to be more suitable for TV viewing.\n2.  **Implement Czech Localization:** Add Czech language support throughout the app. This includes translating all text elements into Czech.\n3.  **Remove Demos:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nAfter you have implemented the plan and modified the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user, please confirm that you have completed these steps.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-25T18:38:29.602838"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an email.cz client app in Czech language optimized for Android TV.
